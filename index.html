            <h1>Treasure Island</h1>

            <p>SQUIRE TRELAWNEY, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having
            asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from
            the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the
            island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I
            take up my pen in the year of grace 17__ and go back to the time when
            my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the
            sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof.</p>
            </p>

            <p>in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and
            broken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of
            stick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared,
            called roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him,
            he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still
            looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard.</p>
          

            <blockquote>You mought call me captain. Oh, I
            see what you're at—there"; and he threw down three or four gold pieces
            on the threshold. "You can tell me when I've worked through that

            <p>My father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity.</p>
            <p>"Well, then," said he, "this is the berth for me. Here you, matey," he
            cried to the man who trundled the barrow; "bring up alongside and help
            up my chest. I'll stay here a bit," he continued. "I'm a plain man; rum
            and bacon and eggs is what I want, and that head up there for to watch
            ships off. What you mought call me? You mought call me captain. Oh, I
            see what you're at—there"; and he threw down three or four gold pieces
            on the threshold. "You can tell me when I've worked through that," says
            he, looking as fierce as a commander.</p>

            <p>He was a very silent man by custom. All day he hung round the cove or
            upon the cliffs with a brass telescope; all evening he sat in a corner
            of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong. Mostly
            he would not speak when spoken to, only look up sudden and fierce and
            blow through his nose like a fog-horn; and we and the people who came
            about our house soon learned to let him be. Every day when he came back
            from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the
            road. At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind
            that made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he was
            desirous to avoid them. When a seaman did put up at the Admiral Benbow
            (as now and then some did, making by the coast road for Bristol) he
            would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the
            parlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such
            was present. For me, at least, there was no secret about the matter, for
            I was, in a way, a sharer in his alarms. He had taken me aside one day
            and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I
            would only keep my "weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg"
            and let him know the moment he appeared. Often enough when the first
            of the month came round and I applied to him for my wage, he would only
            blow through his nose at me and stare me down, but before the week was
            out he was sure to think better of it, bring me my four-penny piece, and
            repeat his orders to look out for "the seafaring man with one leg."</p>
